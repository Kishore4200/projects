# Projects

This repository contains small projects that arose from curiosities in random topics. 

Some of these projects are just code experiments, seeing what I can do with certain libraries. Some others are simply for fun, inspired by an article I read or a cool demo I saw, and some of these are even somewhat practical. Yet others completely random, built almost on a whim.

Some are ready to be used, and others are in development. I work on the core feature of each project first, then focus on building a nice, workable UI for it, then I work on additional nice-to-have features.<br/>
A project will therefore be in one of these three states:
1. Developing - the core functionality has not been completed yet
2. Functioning - the core functionality is complete, but the program does not have a usable UI
3. Usable - program works and has a usable UI

Stay tuned for new projects and cool updates to existing ones, the best is yet to come!

### Project descriptions

<ins>full-stack</ins> (developing)<br/>
Experiments with developing a full stack application, in an attempt to familiarize myself with different tools, such as Django, NodeJS, and ReactJS

<ins>gaze-tracking</ins> (developing)<br/>
An interface that uses gaze tracking and voice commands to allow the user to navigate a computer screen hands-free. 

<ins>image-processing</ins> (usable)<br/>
Experiments with image processing using opencv. Most of the programs are implementations of cool features such as selective coloration, lane detection, and text recognition.

<ins>motion</ins> (usable)<br/>
Programs related to motion, from visualizing and animating a function to the joint-motion project which simulates a different take on pathfinding using machine learning.

<ins>tictactoe</ins> (functioning)<br/>
A human vs computer tictactoe game which the computer will never lose.
