# Projects

This repository contains small projects that arose from curiosities in random topics. 

Some of these projects are just code experiments, seeing what I can do with certain libraries. Some others are simply for fun, inspired by an article I read or a cool demo I saw, and some of these are even somewhat practical. Yet others completely random, built almost on a whim.

Some are ready to be used, and others are in development. I work on the core feature of each project first, then focus on building a nice, workable UI for it, then I work on additional nice-to-have features.<br/>
A project will therefore be in one of these three states:
1. Developing - the core functionality has not been completed yet
2. Functioning - the core functionality is complete, but the program does not have a usable UI
3. Complete - program works and has a usable UI

Stay tuned for new projects and cool updates to existing ones, the best is yet to come!

### Project descriptions

<ins>full-stack</ins> (developing)<br/>
Experiments with developing a full stack application, in an attempt to familiarize myself with different tools, such as Django, NodeJS, and ReactJS.

<ins>gaze-tracking</ins> (developing)<br/>
An interface that uses gaze tracking and voice commands to allow the user to navigate a computer screen hands-free. 

<ins>image-processing</ins> (complete)<br/>
Experiments with image processing using opencv. Most of the programs are implementations of cool features such as selective coloration, lane detection, and text recognition.

<ins>motion</ins> (complete)<br/>
Programs related to motion, including physically realistic bouncing balls, a visualization of the boids flocking algorithm, and the joint-motion project which simulates a different take on pathfinding using machine learning to get a multi jointed arm to reach a specified target point.

<ins>quantum-computing</ins> (complete)<br/>
Experiments in quantum computing to familiarize myself with libraries and implement basic single-purpose programs, mostly based on courses on Udemy and articles or research papers I read.

<ins>reinforcement-learning</ins> (functioning)<br/>
Experiments in reinforcement learning. The gridworld project is implemented from scratch, focusing on the development of two agents, a naive one that learns to associate an action with each position on the board, and a QLearning agent that learns to associate a state-action pair with a reward and solves the grid using epsilon-greedy. Also included are some completed assignments from the Modern RL course on Udemy.

<ins>tictactoe</ins> (complete)<br/>
A human vs computer tictactoe game which the computer will never lose.
