# Random Projects

This repository contains small projects that arose from curiosities in random topics. 
Some of these projects are just code experiments, seeing what I can do with certain libraries. Some others are simply for fun, inspired by an article I read or a cool demo I saw, and some of these are even somewhat practical.
